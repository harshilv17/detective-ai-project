I work the 10 PM to 6 AM shift at Meridian Business Park, which shares its back wall with the old telephone exchange compound. My guard booth is at the vehicle gate on 5th Cross, about forty meters from the exchange building's rear exit.

On the night of March 12th, everything was routine until approximately 11:55 PM. I was doing my hourly perimeter check — I log these on paper and my entry for the 11:30 PM round is timestamped — so I was on my feet, walking along the back wall.

That's when I heard a sharp metallic sound. It was brief — maybe a second or two — like a heavy iron door being slammed, or a metal latch engaging. The sound came from the direction of the exchange building, from the ground floor or possibly the basement level. It was distinct because the area is otherwise very quiet at that hour. There's almost no traffic on 5th Cross after 11 PM.

A few minutes later, I heard a vehicle engine. Not starting up — it was already running, idling very low. The vehicle began to move out of the lane between the exchange and the neighboring warehouse. What caught my attention was how slowly it was moving. Abnormally slowly. Walking pace, maybe even slower. No tire screeching, no urgency. It crept out of the lane and turned onto 5th Cross, heading east toward the main road.

I could see the rear of the vehicle as it passed under the streetlight near the Meridian gate. It was a dark sedan — I couldn't determine the exact shade. The rear license plate was partially visible. I could make out the characters "KA-03" followed by what I believe was either "M" or "N", and then the numbers were obscured — mud or deliberate covering, I can't say. The last digit might have been "7" but I have low confidence in that.

I want to state clearly: I did NOT see the blue light that the other witness reportedly described. My booth faces the rear of the exchange, not the front, so I wouldn't have had a line of sight to the second-floor windows.

The vehicle's headlights came on only after it had traveled approximately twenty or thirty meters from the lane exit. That detail felt wrong to me — you don't drive in the dark with your lights off unless you don't want to be seen.

I did not see anyone enter or exit the vehicle. I did not hear any voices or conversation.

I filed a note in my nightly log about the metallic sound and the slow-moving vehicle, but I did not contact police at that time. I only came forward after hearing about the investigation.
