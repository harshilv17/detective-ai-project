I've been working the graveyard shift at Owl's Brew for about seven months now. The café sits on the corner of MG Road and 4th Cross, right across from the old telephone exchange building. On the night of March 12th, I was alone behind the counter — Tuesday nights are always dead.

I remember checking my phone at 11:45 PM because my roommate had texted me about picking up milk on the way home. That's how I can place the time. The café has floor-to-ceiling glass on the front side, so I have a clear line of sight to the street and the exchange building.

Sometime between 11:50 PM and midnight — I can't be more precise than that — I noticed a flickering blue light coming from the second-floor window of the telephone exchange. It wasn't a steady glow like a screen. It pulsed irregularly, almost like a strobe, but slower. Maybe one flash every two or three seconds. It was a cold, electric blue — not like a TV or phone screen. I watched it for what felt like two or three minutes, though honestly I'm not confident about the duration. Time gets slippery on night shifts.

I looked away to wipe down a counter. When I looked back, the light had stopped.

Around 12:05 AM — give or take five minutes — a dark-colored vehicle pulled out from the narrow lane beside the exchange building. The thing that struck me was that its headlights were off. Completely off. The street has those orange sodium vapor lamps, so I could see the shape of the car, but I couldn't make out the exact color. It looked black or very dark blue, maybe. A sedan, I think, midsized. It turned left onto MG Road heading south.

I didn't see the driver or any passengers. The windows might have been tinted, but at that hour under those lights, I honestly couldn't tell.

I want to be clear: I don't know if the car had anything to do with the blue light. I'm just reporting what I saw. There could have been fifteen minutes between the light stopping and the car appearing, or it could have been two minutes. My sense of time that night is... unreliable.

I didn't hear anything unusual — no loud sounds, no voices. But the café has background music playing and the espresso machine hums, so I might have missed something.

I didn't think any of this was important until I heard that the exchange building was being investigated.
